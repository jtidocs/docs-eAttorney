= Document definitions

A ui:entity[Document Definition] is a file type.
When you add a file/document to a case or person record, you select the document definition for the file.
The document definition has metadata information about the file that can be used throughout the system.

You can get to the ui:screen[Document Definitions] settings page by navigating to menu:Left navigation pane[System Administration > Document Definitions].
There, you can search for or add a ui:entity[Document Definition].


== Search document definitions

The Document Definitions search screen:

From this screen, you can define criteria in the *Search Criteria* panel to find Document Definitions you would like to look at or change.

You can also create a new Document Definition by clicking the *New Definition* button at the bottom of the *Search Criteria* panel.

If you click an existing Document Definition or create a new one, the Document Definition details screen shows, where you can edit the settings and metadata.

You can find information about the various settings in the following sections.

== Document definition information

|===
| Field
| Description

| *Number*
| A unique number that identifies the Document Definition

| *Short Name*

| *Name*
| A more descriptive name than Short Name.

| *Start*
| The date after which this record starts showing as a File Type option.
  If no date is entered, then it defaults to being shown.

Most other fields on the Document Definition are metadata fields that can be referenced in searches, reports, or business rules.


== Attributes

The only attribute you need to worry about setting is the *Form Type* attribute.
Here are the Form Types you can choose from:

|===
| Form Type
| Description

| JDA 4
| Set the Form Type to JDA 4 when the Document Definition has a JDA template attached to it.

| Mugshot
| Use this Form Type for Document Definitions that represent a mugshot.

| Scan/Upload
| Set the Form Type to Scan/Upload to have a Document Definition show on the ui:field[File Type] field on the ui:form[Add File] forms for a case or person.
|===


== Template information

The Template Information section is used to set the JDA template for the Document Definition.
This allows you generate documents from a case or person record.

To add a JDA template to a Document Definition, expand the *Template Information* section, then click the *JDA Template* radio button.
Finally, click the *Select JDA Template* and choose your template.

See the following for an example:

Click btn:[Save] button at the bottom of the screen after selecting your template.

Now you can generate a document using the template you picked for that ui:entity[Document Definition] by navigating to a Case and selecting ui:option[Generate Template] from the ui:dropdown[File Cabinet] dropdown.

NOTE: If you add a JDA template to a Document Definition, it is recommended that you change the <<attributes,Form Type>> to `JDA 4`.

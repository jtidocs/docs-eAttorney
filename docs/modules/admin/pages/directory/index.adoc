= Directory

The directory consists of xref:./person/index.adoc[Persons] and xref:./org_unit.adoc[Organizations].
xref:./person/index.adoc[Persons] and xref:./org_unit.adoc[Organizations] include all people that are part of agencies and organizations that work with you as the customer, such as police and sheriff departments, probation offices, courts, and attorney offices.
If a person is not a victim, witness, plaintiff, defendant, or other such involvement on a case, they are likely to be in Directory.

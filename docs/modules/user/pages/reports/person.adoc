= Person reports

Person reports can be found under the "Reports" tab (shown as 1) in the person folder view.
For information on how to navigate to the person folder view, see xref:person/index.adoc[].

The default report, set by the administrator, shows when navigating to the reports tab.
Reports can be changed by selecting a report from the drop-down menu (shown as 2), and the selected report shows (shown as 3).

Report parameters `personId` and `nameId` are populated with information from the current person record.
Other required parameters need manual input before a report can be displayed.

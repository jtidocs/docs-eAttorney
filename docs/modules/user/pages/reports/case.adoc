= Case reports

Reports based off of case information can be found under the "Reports" tab (shown as 1) in the case folder view.
For information on how to navigate to the case folder, see xref:cases/index.adoc[].

The default report, set by the administrator, shows when navigating to the reports tab.

Reports can be selected from the drop-down combo box (shown as 2), and they show, as shown by #3.

For a case report, the `caseid` report parameter is populated with the id of the current case.
Other required parameters need manual input before viewing a report.

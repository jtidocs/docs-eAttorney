= Cases

Cases are the main workspace for the majority of tasks on a daily basis.
A case keeps track of:
- Who: case-involved people like prosecutors or defendants.
- What: charges against the defendant.
- When: the date of occurrence or events.
- Where: the `location`.

These data points (and more) make up a typical case.


== Case folder views

The case folder view has all information about the case, including:

- Involvements.
- Connected cases.
- Justice personnel.
- Case status history.
- Special status on the case.

There are three ways to reach the case folder view:

. Through the case search found in the navigation bar under menu:Searches & Reports[Search Case] and filling out case information.

. If the current user has assigned cases cases, the view pops up in menu:Workspace[Recent Cases > Select Case].

. Clicking on the most recent case in the top right corner.

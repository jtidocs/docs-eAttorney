. The case ledger folder view displays the fines and fees associated with the current case.

. Receipts for individual payments can be found under the fines and fees.


== Historic financials

Historic financial folder view displays all obligations attached to the case.
The obligations show the "original amount" and "balance at conversion" (If the {product} instance comes from a converted database).
From the list you can view the payments and the full payment record by clicking the credit card icon (view payments) or the person icon (full payment record).

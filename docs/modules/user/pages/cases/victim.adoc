Victims can have many things added to them for VOCA reporting.
In the case view, there are three items that can be added for automatic generation of the VOCA report:

. Add Victimization - Adds victimization type.
. Add Special Classification - Adds special classification of victimization (for example Homeless, LGBTQ, Veteran, and others).
. Add Service - Add service provided to victim.

For more information on VOCA reporting, see xref:searches/voca.adoc[].

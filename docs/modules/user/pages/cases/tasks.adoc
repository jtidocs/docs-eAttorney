Updating the assignment also updates the assigned user in the workspace.
You can also update the assignment from the workspace.
When complete, you can select the `complete` box to remove the workspace item or use the `Done` result from the workspace.


== Checklists

Checklists are a set of tasks and are configured by an administrator.


=== Add a checklist

Checklists are added to cases by clicking menu:Tasks[Add Checklist].

The add checklist screen allows the user to select all of the checklist or elements of the checklist to add.
Checklists do not allow duplicate items to exist on a case.

For example: a user adds item 1 from checklist and clicks `Save and Assign`.
Item 1 cannot be added a second time to the case.

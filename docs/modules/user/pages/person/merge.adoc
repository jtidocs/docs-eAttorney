= Merge person records

When multiple records of the same person exist in the system, those records can be merged into one person record.
Merging person records can be done in the person folder view, under the menu:Summary[Person Merge].
To merge person records, a search level needs to be set to match potential duplicate records:

|===
| Level
| Search criteria

| Level 1
| Matching first and last names

| Level 2
| Matching first, last, and middle names

| Level 3
| Matching first, last names, and date of birth
|===

Once the search is complete, person records can be selected based on search criteria and merged together by clicking btn:[merge].

After selecting people and clicking merge, a merge confirmation opens to ensure that no errors have occurred:

After confirmation, the two records are combined into one.

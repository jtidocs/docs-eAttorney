This ui:screen[Disbursement] screen shows.
To create a disbursement:

. If you are coming from the ui:screen[Cash Receipts] screen with a case already selected, then the ui:entity[Cases] search is populated from the current case.
If not, add the case to the ui:entity[Cases] search for which you want to create a disbursement, then click btn:[Search].

. Enter the disbursement amount, then click btn:[Update Disbursement Amount].
This is likely the same amount as the payment that you took on the ui:screen[Cash Receipts] screen.

. Verify the amount of each selected restitution record.
If there are multiple restitution records, you may need to manually adjust how much money is coming from where.

. Select the payee and the address of the person who should receive the restitution.

. Verify that the information is correct for the payee.
This should be the check recipient.

. Click btn:[Create Disbursement Voucher] to finalize the disbursement.

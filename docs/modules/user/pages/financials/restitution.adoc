== Taking a restitution payment

Taking a payment for restitution is done in the same way as all other payments in the system, by going to the *Cash Receipts* screen and entering the payment information.

See the xref:./cash_receipts.adoc[] for details on how to take a payment.


== Disbursing restitution

After taking a payment for restitution, it needs to be disbursed.

This *Disbursement* screen shows.
Create a disbursement by doing the following (see image below):

. If you are coming from the *Cash Receipts* screen with a case already selected, then the _Cases_ search is populated from the current case.
  If not, add the case to the _Cases_ search that you want to create a disbursement for, then click btn:[Search].

. Enter the disbursement amount and click the button btn:[Update Disbursement Amount].
  This is likely the same amount as the payment that you took on the *Cash Receipts* screen.

  If there are multiple restitution records, you may need to manually adjust how much money is coming from where.

. Select the payee and the address for who should rec\eive the restitution.

. Verify the information is correct for the payee.
  This is who the check should go to.

. Click the _Create Disbursement Voucher_ button to finalize the disbursement.

= Transfers

Generally, transfers are made when a payment is taken and is allocated to the wrong item.
The most common scenario of this is when a payment is applied to the wrong case or obligation.

== Creating a transfer: between single case obligations

For this example, assume there is a payment made to the wrong obligation for the same case.
To fix that scenario:

Navigate to the ui:screen[Cash Receipts] screen from the case: click the ui:dropdown[Financials] dropdown, then select ui:option[Cash Receipts].

In this screen, notice the $20 payment towards ui:entity[Bail].
That money should be moved from the ui:entity[Bail] obligation to the ui:option[DA FEE].

While on the ui:screen[Cash Receipts] screen, click the ui:dropdown[More Actions] dropdown at the bottom right of the screen, then select ui:option[Transfer].

=== Step 1: items deducting money

On the ui:screen[Transfer] screen, there should be a case with paid financials.
If you accessed the screen from some other location and do not find a case, search for the case you need to transfer funds from.
Payments made on this case should show in the ui:panel[Selected Items to Deduct Money] panel.

Click btn:[Next].


=== Step 2: items receiving money

The ui:panel[Step 2: Manage Items to Receive Money] panel shows after the first:

In this example, money should be moved from one obligation to another.
In the ui:panel[Choose and Add Items to Receive Money] section, select the items to transfer to.
You can also select multiple obligations, if needed.

Click btn:[Add Selected Items for Receiving Money].

The ui:panel[Items to Receive Money] panel should populate.
You can enter the amount you need to transfer to the obligations:

Click btn:[Transfer] to complete the transfer.

Once the transfer is complete, you can navigate to the ui:screen[Case Ledger] and review the changes.
You should be able to follow the money trail.
In the following screenshot, an original $20 payment for ui:entity[Bail] is shown.
It is now deducted and moved to the ui:option[DA FEE].
The ui:option[DA FEE] is reduced in the amount of $20.
Note the `Transferred Payment` badge on the ui:option[DA FEE].

There should also be a receipt in reference to the transfer.


== Creating a transfer: case-to-case transfers

For this example, assume that a payment is made to an obligation on the wrong case and it must be applied to another case.
To start fixing that scenario, use the same exact case as in the previous example, so there is $20.00 on the ui:entity[Bail] paid.

Navigate to the ui:screen[Cash Receipts] screen from the case.

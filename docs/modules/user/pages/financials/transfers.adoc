= Transfers

Generally, transfers are made when a payment is taken and is allocated to the wrong item.
The most common scenario of this is when a payment is applied to the wrong case or obligation.

== Creating a transfer: between single case obligations

For this example, assume there is a payment made to the wrong obligation on the same case.
To fix that scenario.

Navigate to the `Cash Receipts` screen from the case.

In this screen, notice the $20 payment towards Bail.
That money should be moved from the Bail obligation to the DA FEE.

While on this `Cash Receipts` screen, click the `More Actions` drop-down at the bottom right of the screen and click `Transfer`.

=== Step 1: items deducting money

Inside the `Transfer screen`, there should be a case with paid financials.
If you accessed the screen from some other location and do not see a case, search for the case you need to transfer funds from.
Payments made on this case should show in the `Selected Items to Deduct Money`.

=== Step 2: items receiving money

After clicking the next button, an extra panel shows below the first.

In this example, money should be moved from one obligation to another.
In the **Choose and Add Items to R\eceive Money** section, select the items to transfer to.
You can also select multiple obligations, if needed.

Click the btn:[Add Selected Items for Receiving Money] button.

The `Items to R\eceive Money` panel should populate, allowing you to enter the amount you would like to transfer to the obligations.

Once you have entered the amount you would like to transfer, move on to Step 3.


=== Step 3: transfer information

The last step is to enter the `Invoice Action`, `Reason`, and `Comments` you would like to add.

Click the btn:[Transfer Button].

Once the transfer is complete, you can optionally go to the Case Ledger and reviewing the changes.
You should be able to see the money trail.
In the following image, an original $20 payment for Bail is shown.
It is now deducted and moved to the DA FEE.
The DA FEE is reduced in the amount of $20.
Notice there is a `Transferred Payment` marking on the DA FEE.

Also, there should be a receipt in reference to the transfer.


== Creating a transfer: case-to-case transfers

For this example, assume that a payment is made to an obligation on the wrong case and it needs to go to another case.
To start fixing that scenario, use the same exact case as in the previous example, so there is $20.00 on the Bail paid.

Navigate to the `Cash Receipts` screen from the case.

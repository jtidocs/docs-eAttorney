After selecting your option to open your till, you are prompted to open a till if it is the first time you have accessed Cash Receipts for the day.

NOTE: If you have an unclosed till from a previous day, you are prompted to close that till before you can proceed.

You can easily see if you have opened your till by looking at the top of {product} in your browser.
Your till number and a cash register icon displays at the top of the screen.

[#navigate]
== Navigate the cash receipts screen

If you access Cash Receipts from a case you can see the owed financials for that case.
Otherwise, you need to search for the case if you are wanting to take payments for that case.

The Search Cases field in the Cash Receipts screen can be used to display a Case Assessment Detail panel.

By typing in the case number, or name of the case, the search displays a list of cases:

By choosing a case from the list, the Case Assessment Detail panel is displayed.
By searching and choosing another case, multiple panels can be displayed.
A benefit of opening multiple cases is the ability to take payments over more than one case at once.

[#switch]
== Switch till modes

Users that are taking mailed in payments can switch their Till Mode in the cash receipts screen.
By default, tills are set to use the Counter mode.
The background for this is set as blue and the top left icon displays a cash register icon.
This is part of core and cannot be customized.

If a user needs to record a payment made by mail, they click the cash register icon in the upper left corner of the Cash Receipts screen.
This changes the background to yellow and updates the cash register icon to an envelope icon.

[#navigate]
== Navigate the cash receipts screen

By choosing a case from the list, the ui:panel[Case Assessment Detail] panel shows.
By searching and choosing another case, multiple panels can be shown.

[#switch]
== Switch till modes

Users that are taking mailed-in payments can switch their ui:field[Till Mode] in the ui:screen[Cash Receipts] screen.

The background color is blue and the top left icon shows a ui:icon[Cash Register] icon.
This is part of core and cannot be customized.

If a user needs to record a payment made by mail, they click the ui:icon[Cash Register] icon in the upper left corner of the ui:screen[Cash Receipts] screen.
This changes the background color to yellow and replaces the ui:icon[Cash Register] icon with an ui:icon[Envelope] icon.

To complete the refund request, enter an invoice action (ui:option[No Action] or ui:option[Rescind]), enter the reason for the refund, and optionally add comments about the refund.
After filling in the required information, click btn:[Create Refund Request] to create the refund request that somebody else must approve.


== Approve a refund request

When a user creates a refund request, it must be approved by a different {product} user.
The user that should approve the refund request must be a member of the ui:role[Financial General Workflow Role] or the ui:role[Financial Admin Workflow Role].
Those roles are xref:admin:users/accounts.adoc#workflow-roles[set by an administrator].

If a refund request exists, and the user wanting to approve a request is a member of the appropriate ui:role[Workflow Role], then the refund request shows on their ui:gadget[Assignments] gadget on their ui:screen[Dashboard].
It is labeled as ui:label[Approve Refund Request]:

If the user clicks btn:[â–¶], it assigns them the task and shows the ui:screen[Refund Request] screen where they can approve or deny the refund request:

To approve the refund request, the user must click btn:[Complete].
Or, the user can choose to deny the request by adding comments to the ui:field[Deny Comments] field, then clicking btn:[Deny].

Once a refund request is approved, the refund can be sent to the payee.


== Send a refund

After the refund request is created and approved, the refund can be sent to the individual.
Typically, this is done by writing a check to the refund recipient.
See xref:./check_writing.adoc[] for details on how to complete that task.

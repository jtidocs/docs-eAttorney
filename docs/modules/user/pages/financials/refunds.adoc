To complete the refund request, enter an invoice action (No Action or Rescind), enter the reason for the refund, and optionally add comments about the refund.
After filling in the required information, click the btn:[Create Refund Request] button to create the refund request that somebody else needs to approve.


== Approving a refund request

When a user creates a refund request, it must be approved by a different {product} user.
The user that should approve the refund request must be a member of the *Financial General* Workflow Role or the *Financial Admin* Workflow Role.
Those roles are xref:admin:users/accounts.adoc#workflow-roles[set by an administrator].

If a refund request exists, and the user wanting to approve a request is a member of the appropriate Workflow Role, then the refund request shows on their Assignments gadget on their Dashboard.
It is labeled as _Approve Refund Request_:

If the user clicks the btn:[â–¶] icon, it auto assigns them the task and displays the Refund Request screen where they can approve or deny the refund request (see below).

To approve the refund request, the user needs to click the btn:[Complete] button.
Or, the user can choose to deny the request by adding comments to the _Deny Comments_ field and then click the btn:[Deny] button.

Once a refund request is approved, the refund can be sent to the payee.


== Sending a refund

After the refund request is created and approved, the refund can be sent to the individual.
Typically, this is done by writing a check to the refund recipient.
See xref:./check_writing.adoc[] for details on how to complete that task.

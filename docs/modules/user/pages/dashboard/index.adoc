== Multiple tabs

An individual dashboard may be configured to use an arbitrary number of Gadgets, including multiple copies of the same Gadget with different configurations.
Despite this, users may find it more convenient to add more tabs to the dashboard, creating different screens for different types of information or tasks.

To add more tabs:

. Browse to the existing dashboards by clicking the {product} logo at the top-left of the screen.
. Click the _Add New Tab_ button, represented as a `+`, next to the "User Settings" gear icon.

. Fill in the prompt with the name of the new dashboard, then click btn:[OK].
. The new tab behaves exactly like the first dashboard, the only difference being separately configured Gadgets.

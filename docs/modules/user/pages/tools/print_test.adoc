The {product} scan and print service is a background service that runs on the client machine, and handles printing to the user local machine and scanning from the local machine into {product}.
After launch, the service listens for print or scan requests and takes action when requests arrive.


== Print test page

Test the Service by printing a test page.


== Open scanner

Launch the scanning app.


== Launch service

Launching the service should only occur once.
If the service is running, you should see the EC icon in the user system tray:

Some modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) no longer support running Java Applets in the browser.
For those users running a modern browser, start the service with a startup task:

[source, terminal]
----
javaws -Xnosplash http://<<server:port>>/<<context>>/document/ec-service.jsp
----

.Example:
[source, terminal]
----
javaws -Xnosplash http://lasccivil-config.ecourt.com/sustain/document/ec-service.jsp
----


.Using IcedTea:
[source, terminal]
----
javaws -Xtrustnone -headless -jnlp http://<<server:port>>/<<context>>/document/ec-service.jsp
----

.Example:
[source, terminal]
----
javaws -Xtrustnone -headless -jnlp http://ecourtuatcu.lacourt.org/ecourt/document/ec-service.jsp
----

This command runs in the startup folder and is available in the latest 2016-sr2, not 2016-sr3, 2016-sr4+.


== Check service communication

Test the communication to the service to make sure there are no connection issues.

If the service is running on the user computer, testing communication and print test page should complete quickly.
If not, investigate the networking / firewall issue mentioned in <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting>>.

== Troubleshooting

=== Problems launching the service

Due to security restrictions, Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome no longer support running Java applets in the browser.
// TODO: Add the mentioned service section, including the command to launch the service.
For those users running Edge or Chrome, {company-full} recommends launching the scan and print service when logging on (refer to the command to launch the service section).
For browsers still supporting applets, like Internet Explorer, {company} recommends that you verify that Java is installed correctly.
The easiest way to do that is to visit https://java.com/[java.com^] and click btn:[`Do I have Java?`].
If https://java.com/[java.com^] successfully verifies that everything is installed correctly you should have no problems launching the service in {product}.

NOTE: the service should only launch once.

If users see the service launches each time they try to print, then network issues are probably preventing proper communication between the server and user machines.
See <<network>>.


[#network]
=== Networking issues

Due to security restrictions from the browser, these requests do not come from the browser itself but from the {product} app server.
The {product} app server tries to access the scan service on the client machine.
The network settings must be set up correctly for the {product} service to run fast / correctly.
By default these requests come from the {product} server to the client machine port 8383.
This port must not be blocked on the user firewall.
Under normal firewall setup this port is not blocked for local network traffic.

In addition, if the {product} server is not a local server but a hosted or remote server, the router/firewall from the remote location must be allowed through.

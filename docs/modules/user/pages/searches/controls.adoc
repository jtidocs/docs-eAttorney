=== Example of in and not-in comparison types

The *_in_* Comparison Type only works with multi select dropdown values.
This example shows how the results are limited to the selected status values of Adult Drug Court and Declined for lack of Investigation.
No other Statuses are returned in this search.

*Example of Group By results with _Case Name_ and _Case Type_ dual groupings*:

If grouping is used and there are multiple results which fall under the same grouping, an expansion opens in the results which allows you to see all items in that group.
This example shows that 4 cases were found which match the same Case Title and the same Case Type:

. *Results Dropdown* -  Select the number of results you would like to see per results page.

image::searches/search-controls-results-dropdown.png[Bottom Search Controls Results Dropdown.]

. *Criteria Dropdown* -  Whittle down results based on criteria.
+
The Criteria option only shows on the _Search Case_ and the _Search Person Business_ searches.
This allows you to directly add the Case Id or Person Id into the Criteria Field when doing a search to net the exact result you are looking for.
In the below example, the Add Criteria dropdown option of Person Id on the Search Person/Business search is selected.
This enabled a new parameter for entry called Person Id.
Person Id 2 is included in that Person Id Parameter.
+

The single result for the person associated with Person Id 2 is the only result as desired.

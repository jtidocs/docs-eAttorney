=== Example of Group By results with `Case Name` and `Case Type` dual groupings*:

If grouping is used and there are multiple results which fall under the same grouping, an expansion opens in the results to show all items in that group.
This example shows that four cases were found which match the same Case Title and the same Case Type:

[[extra]]
== Extra criteria

Use the dropdown to select ui:option[Case Id] or ui:option[Person Id], which adds the selected field to the search form.

IMPORTANT: The ui:dropdown[Additional Criteria] dropdown only shows on the ui:screen[Search Case] and ui:screen[Search Person/Business] searches.

In the following example, the ui:option[Person Id] is selected in the dropdown on the ui:dialog[Search Person/Business] dialog.
The selection add the ui:field[Person Id] field to the search form.
The ui:field[Person Id] is set to `2`.

When the search executes, there is only one result because each ui:field[Person Id] is unique.

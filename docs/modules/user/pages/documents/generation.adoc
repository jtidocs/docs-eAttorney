= Document generation

Document Generation allows a user to generate documents from templates.
These templates can be stand-alone without user input or require input from the user to finish generation.

. *Form* - Select the form you wish to generate from the dropdown.
. *Add* - Add a document to the Case or Person Filing Cabinet.
. *Preview* - Download a document for preview.

When generating a template, you have the choice to btn:[Add] or to btn:[Preview] the document.

If btn:[Add] is chosen, the document generates and saves to the filing cabinet of the Case or Person record you are viewing.
If btn:[Preview] is chosen, an example of the file which should be added is downloaded to your computer so you can examine the document before it is added to the filing cabinet.

If a template requires user input or has dialogs, the user must enter data in a dialog pop-up.

Once the user has finished entering the required data, the document should be available in the Filing Cabinet.

If the template requires no input from the user, the template generates and saves to the filing cabinet without further interaction from the user.
